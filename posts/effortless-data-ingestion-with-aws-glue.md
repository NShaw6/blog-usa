Its common knowledge that data is the driving force in pivotal business decisions every single day. The issue is, with data sets growing as a result of every business event, managing this data and discovering the most critical bits can be a daunting task. This is where AWS Glue can provide some help, by utilizing common capabilities for uncovering potentially undiscovered insights across multiple streams.

AWS provides an encompassing Glue landscape where users can leverage technology to not only uncover data, but also gain valuable insight to guide decision and strategy. With numerous ways to leverage these capabilities, users from both technical and non-technical backgrounds can drive this effort forward. This blog will discuss how to get started ingesting some common data streams with a non-technical approach. Thus setting you on the course to make better informed decisions for your business.

# Common Input Streams
Data resides in a myriad of locations. Below we will describe a few popular data sources which can be leveraged in AWS Glue with no coding expertise needed.

- **Databases**: At the core of every business is its data, and what more popular way to store that data then a database? AWS Glue is capable of connecting to multiple different database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB and many more.
- **Amazon S3**: Amazon’s simple storage service, a common place for data storage and archival. S3 is another popular data storage option which Glue can integrate with seamlessly.
- **Snowflake**: A popular cloud-base data warehousing platform which provides powerful data storage, processing, and analysis capabilities. Coupled with AWS Glue it can create a robust data integration solution.
- **Apache Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform commonly built to process real-time event driven data, representing another possible data ingestion point for AWS Glue.
- **Kinesis**: A suite of AWS services which simplify the process of collecting and streaming data in real-time, all of which can be consumed by AWS Glue.

The above examples only capture a few of the possible data ingestion points which Glue can utilize. Be sure to check out if Glue has an out of the box connection for any of your data ingestion streams of interest.

# Why Leverage Multiple Input Streams?
Each piece of data represents a snippet of what makes your business special. By treating each input as a valuable source of information AWS Glue can significantly enhance the flexibility, efficiency and performance of your data processing capabilities. Utilizing multiple input streams will empower you to harness the full potential of your data, creating a versatile, efficient and cost effective data integration process which can adapt to the dynamic needs of your organization's complex data ecosystem.

# Getting Started with AWS Glue Visual ETL
AWS glue provides a visual interface designed for creating ETL jobs. This interface enables users to build ETL workflows utilizing a graphical representation of the data transformation process. These visually composed workflows can be run on AWS Glue’s Apache Spark-based ETL engine, allowing you to inspect the data each step of the way.

To get started, navigate to AWS Glue Studios and create a job using the visual editor as shown.

You should then be greeted by a graphical representation of your Glue job. You can remove any boiler plate connections and provide any necessary job details before moving forward. Once ready select the add nodes icon and search for the associated source you’d like to explore.


## Example: Creating a PostgreSQL Connection
In the Add nodes drop down search for PostgreSQL and select the Source option as shown.

Once you’ve added the node you’ll be able to add the details associated with your connection. For PostgreSQL (similar to many other database engines) you have the option of providing the JDBC connection details or selecting a database catalog table. For the sake of this blog, we will select the JDBC connection details and create a connection ourselves utilizing the AWS create a connection wizard.

On the next page provide the details associated with your unique connection. The below screenshot shows an RDS connection which may differ based on your own setup.

# Building on This Process
This process of selecting the associated node and providing the details for your specific connection can be repeated as many times as you’d like inside of a Glue job. As you are building out your connections graphically you will find a similar experience with all of the available input options. As you are setting up these inputs you’ll quickly realize that this is only the beginning of your data discovery journey. With the skill of Glue job creation under your belt you’ll be on your way to streamlining the process of preparing and transforming your data. Making your data more accessible, reliable, and actionable which can deliver a direct business impact.

# Conclusion
AWS Glue empowers businesses by demystifying the ETL data process, making it accessible to technical and non-technical team members alike. With the provided user-friendly interface and automated data extraction capabilities, Glue allows users to load and transform an exuberant volume of data without the need for extensive coding expertise. This accessibility ensures that data-driven decision-making is achievable in every corridor of business.
